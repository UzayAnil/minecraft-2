    <p> Minecraft is a sandbox video game created by Markus Persson, which was later developed and published by Mojang.  There are three modes you can play in: Survival, Creative, and Hardcore.  You can play all of these modes in multiplayer by using your landline or setting up a server, which costs money.  In Survival mode, you adventure into a world of danger, where you have to gather resources and craft items to survive.  There are also monsters that come out at night who want to break/explode/eat your bones.  You will need to build a safe place to hide from the monsters.  However, if you think you are ready to face them, then you can try killing them and gathering their resources.Next is Creative mode.  If you are more interested in making cool designs, huge structures, and anything you can think of, Creative mode is your best bet.  You have unlimited resources of items and you donâ€™t have to worry about the monsters.  
Finally, the is Hardcore Mode.  Harcore mode is very similar to Survival Mode, BUT you CAN NOT DIE or else you permanently lose all your progress and have to start a new world.</p>
